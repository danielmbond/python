# Remove Torrents and Files from qBittorrent

Run this script removes torrents from the qBittorent client.  If the torrents are from private trackers it will force start them for the time you specify.

## Getting Started

Setup a scheduled task to run this script.  I run it every 30 minutes.  Configure qBittorent to remove Torrents after a specific amount of time.  This will remove the torrents that aren't in force start.  21,600‬ minutes = 15 days.
